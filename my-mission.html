    <h1>My Mission</h1>
    <h2>A Woof to All Humans and Fellow Four-Legged Friends!</h2>
    <p>
        I am Bleu, the Robinhood of Dogs. My dream? A world where every stray dog knows the joy of a full belly and the wag of a hopeful tail. Together, we can turn this dream into reality, one burger at a time.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I’m not your ordinary dog—I’m a superdog on a mission of justice. While others chase tails, I chase purpose. My goal is simple yet bold: to create a world where no dog is left behind, where every street dog can savor the joy of a burger… or even a cheeseburger (when we’re feeling fancy).
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives My Mission?</h2>
    <ul class="mission-points">
        <li>Transform what humans give (or overlook) into life-saving meals for dogs in need.</li>
        <li>Harness the power of blockchain to ensure every transaction leaves behind hope for stray dogs.</li>
        <li>Fight hunger and illness with every burger shared, every token donated, and every wag of support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Blockchain technology is our secret weapon, turning everyday human actions into resources for dogs. Whether it’s burgers for bellies, medicine for cures, or shelters for safety—this is more than a mission. It’s a revolution.
    </p>

    <h2>A Message to My Homeless Dog Siblings</h2>
    <p>
        Dear brothers and sisters of the streets, I see you. I hear you. I am fighting for you. While humans swipe their cards, I will ensure their kindness turns into full bowls, warm beds, and better health for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every burger I fetch through this mission is for you. Every wag of my tail is a promise of a better tomorrow. Together, we will taste not just burgers—but victory.
    </p>

    <h2>A Call to Humans Who Care</h2>
    <p>
        This is your moment to make a difference. By supporting Bleu, you’re joining a movement where justice is served with every burger, and hope is powered by every token. Together, we’ll show the world that even the smallest act of kindness can make the biggest difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Join me. Let’s ensure no dog is left behind. Together, we’ll build a brighter, burger-filled future.
