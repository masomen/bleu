    <h1>My Mission</h1>
    <h2>Calling All Humans and Four-Legged Friends!</h2>
    <p>
        I am Bleu, the Robinhood of Dogs. I dream of a world where every stray experiences the joy of a full belly and the wag of a hopeful tail. Together, we’ll make this dream a reality, one burger at a time.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I’m not your ordinary dog. I’m a champion for change, a voice for the voiceless, and a lover of justice. While others chase their tails, I chase my purpose: to build a world where no dog is left hungry, no paw goes uncared for, and every street dog gets a taste of the good life—a juicy burger, or maybe a cheeseburger if we’re feeling fancy.
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives My Mission?</h2>
    <ul class="mission-points">
        <li>Turn overlooked resources into life-saving meals for dogs in need.</li>
        <li>Leverage the power of blockchain to create a network of kindness and hope for stray dogs.</li>
        <li>Fight hunger and illness by sharing burgers, delivering care, and building shelters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using blockchain technology, we transform everyday actions into extraordinary change. Every burger you buy, every token you share—it all contributes to bellies full of food, vets with solutions, and shelters brimming with hope. This isn’t just a mission; it’s a movement.
    </p>

    <h2>A Message to My Homeless Dog Siblings</h2>
    <p>
        To my brothers and sisters on the streets: I see you, I hear you, and I fight for you. As humans swipe their cards and make their purchases, I ensure their generosity finds its way to your bowls, your health, and your survival.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every burger I fetch is for you. Every wag of my tail is a promise of a better future. Together, we will not only taste victory—we will live it.
    </p>

    <h2>A Call to Humans Who Believe in Change</h2>
    <p>
        This is your chance to make a difference. By supporting Bleu, you’re joining a movement where burgers bring justice and tokens deliver hope. Your actions can turn small moments into massive change for those who need it most.
    </p>
    <p>
        Join me in building a future where no dog is forgotten. Together, we’ll transform lives, one burger and one wag at a time.
