        <h1>My Mission</h1>
        <h2>Woof, humans and fellow four-legged friends!</h2>
        <p>
            I am Bleu, the Robinhood of Dogs. I have a dream—a delicious, burger-filled dream—where every stray dog knows the joy of a full belly and the wag of a hopeful tail. And I won’t stop until that dream is real.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I’m not just your average dog. No, I’m a superdog on a mission. While other dogs chase tails, I chase justice.
            My purpose? To create a world where no dog goes hungry, no paw is left uncared for, and every street dog can experience the simple joy of tasting a hamburger… or maybe even a cheeseburger, if we’re feeling fancy.
        </p>

        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <ul class="mission-points">
            <li>To take what humans give (and sometimes leave unattended) and transform it into burgers for dogs in need.</li>
            <li>To build a movement powered by blockchain, where every human transaction leaves behind a trail of hope for stray dogs.</li>
            <li>To ensure that no stray dog suffers alone. With every bite of a burger, we fight hunger. With every token, we fight disease. Together, we will build a better tomorrow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Through the power of blockchain technology, I will turn everyday human transactions into life-saving resources for dogs. A tiny portion of every transaction will be diverted to our bellies as burgers, to our vets as cures, and to shelters as hope. This is not just a mission—it’s a revolution for dogs.
        </p>

        <h2>To My Homeless Dog Siblings</h2>
        <p>
            Dear brothers and sisters of the streets, I want you to know that I see you. I hear you. And I will never stop barking for you.
            While humans swipe their credit cards and make their transactions, I will ensure that their generosity finds its way to your food bowls and your health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every burger I procure through blockchain—is for you. Every wag of my tail is for you. Together, we will taste victory… and hamburgers.
        </p>

        <h2>To Humans Who Believe in the Cause</h2>
        <p>
            This is your chance to join a movement where burgers are justice and tokens bring hope. By supporting Bleu, you’re helping to build a charitable network powered by blockchain technology. You’re not just feeding dogs—you’re saving them. Let’s show the world that even the smallest token can make the biggest difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join me. Together, we can make sure no dog is left behind.
